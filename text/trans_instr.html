<p>Thanks for helping translate this app to more languages!</p>

<div class="news"><p><b>Note:</b> <em>This is beta software. It is
proving useful and reliable so far, but be aware that you might
encounter the occasional problem.</em></p></div>

<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>

<ul class="instructions">
<li>Save your work frequently to avoid losing data if anything goes
wrong.  When you press a <b><i>Save All</i></b> button, all fields are
saved, then you are returned to your position in the page.</li>

<li>In general, whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is ignored. The
exception is for fields surrounded by double-quotes
(<b>&quot;</b>). If the English field is quoted, you should mostly
likely quote your translation and make sure to match spacing (usually
this is used to ensure that there is a trailing space).</li>

<li>When you see <b><code>\n</code></b>, that tells Android to insert
a newline.  In most cases, you should have <b><code>\n</code></b> in
the same place in your translation.</li>

<li>Similarly, HTML code such as <b><code>&lt;b&gt;</code></b>
or <b><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></b> should probably be used in your
translation exactly as they are in English.</li>

<li>"Plurals" are last (all the way at the bottom of this page). Only
fill out the ones you need. For example, in English the special case
is one, which uses the singular form; all other quantities, including
zero, use the plural form. So the English Plurals listed use only
'one' and 'other', with the rest left blank. In general, you should
put the common form in 'other' and then fill in whichever special
cases your language uses.  The <b><code>%d</code></b> is where the
numeral will be filled in by the app.</li>

<li>Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.</li>
</ul>
