<p><b><i>News:</i></b> Android Translation Helper is now on a new
host, and it has been upgraded during the transition.  It is now much
faster (although, as always, Firefox renders the textareas rather
slowly; Chrome is the recommended browser.) It should now properly
handle conflicts if two translators working on the same translation at
the same time translate something differently. There have been a few
cosmetic changes, bugs have been fixed, and planned features will be
easier to implement.</p>
