<p>Thanks for helping to translate Battery Indicator to more languages!</p> 
<b>Instructions:</b> 
<ul>
<li>I'm pretty sure this works, but let's call it beta for now. Let me know if you have any issues.</li>
<li>Save your work frequently.  When you press the 'Save All' button, all fields are saved, then
you are returned to your position in the page.</li>
<li>In general, whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is ignored. Exceptions are noted.</li>
<li>When you see <b><code>\n</code></b>, that tells Android to insert a newline. 
    In most cases, you should have <b><code>\n</code></b> in the same place in your translation.</li>
<li>Similarly, HTML code such as <b><code>&lt;b&gt;</code></b> or <b><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></b>
    should probably be used in your translation exactly as they are in English.</li>
<li>Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. (Contact info listed in the Android Market.)</li>
</ul>
