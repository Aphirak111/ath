<p>Thanks for helping to translate Battery Indicator to more languages!</p> 
<b>Instructions:</b> 
<ul>
<li>I'm pretty sure this works, but let's call it beta for now. Let me know if you have any issues.</li>
<li>Save your work frequently to avoid losing your work if anything
goes wrong.  When you press the 'Save All' button, all fields are
saved, then you are returned to your position in the page.</li>
<li>In general, whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is ignored. Exceptions are noted.</li>
<li>When you see <b><code>\n</code></b>, that tells Android to insert a newline. 
    In most cases, you should have <b><code>\n</code></b> in the same place in your translation.</li>
<li>Similarly, HTML code such as <b><code>&lt;b&gt;</code></b> or <b><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></b>
    should probably be used in your translation exactly as they are in English.</li>
<li><b><i>New</i>:</b> I forgot about Plurals at first; they're here now. You'll find them listed last
(all the way at the bottom of this page). Only fill out the ones you need. For example,
in English the special case is one, which uses the singular form; all other quantities, including zero,
use the plural form. So the English Plurals listed use only 'one' and 'other', with the rest
left blank. In general, you should put the common form in 'other' and then fill in whichever
special cases your language uses.  The <b><code>%d</code></b> is where the numeral will be
filled in by the app.</li>
<li>Chrome is the recommended browser.  Firefox works fine, but tends to render very slowly
because of all the text fields.</li>
<li>Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. (Contact info listed in the Android Market.)</li>
</ul>
